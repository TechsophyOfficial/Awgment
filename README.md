# Introduction

Awgment Platform is a comprehensive cloud native platform for rapid development, deployment, monitor and change management of enterprise application. Awgment focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments. By using Awgment to integrate models and data into native services, developers can create powerful products or services leveraging cloud-native technologies.

An overview of individual components can be found [here](docs/overview.md)
